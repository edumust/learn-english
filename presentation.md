# Introduce yourself for formal or new presentation

Good morning everyone.
For those who don’t know me, my name’s Simon, and I work in the marketing department.

Hello everybody.
Before we begin, let me introduce myself briefly: I’m Reese and I’m the head of HR.

Hi guys; if you don’t know me, I’m Sylvia and I work in digital marketing.

Hello!
I see some new faces, so I’ll introduce myself first: I’m Julia and I’m one of
our customer service team.

# Introduce your topic
[
Today, I’m going to be talking about our new HR policies and how they affect you.

I’d like to talk to you today about quality control and why we’re all responsible
for quality control, whichever department you work in.

I’ll begin by outlining the policies, and
then I’ll go on to highlight what they mean for you and your working habits.
Finally, I’ll briefly discuss why we feel these new policies are necessary and beneficial
for us all.

First of all, I’ll explain why ‘quality
control’ has a broader meaning than you might expect.
I’ll continue by giving examples of real quality control, and why this matters for
all of us.
To finish, I’ll be asking you to think of ways you can incorporate quality control into
your working habits.

Have you ever felt unfairly treated at work, or felt that the work you do isn’t appreciated?
We’ve been working to design new HR policies that will make sure all staff get fair recognition
for their contribution to the company.

Did you know that the average office worker spends eight hours a day at work, but only
does four hours of productive, useful work?
I’m here to tell you about ‘quality control’, and how you can use this idea to make better
use of your time.

I once met a young salesman—I won’t mention his name.
He spent several weeks building a relationship with a potential client.
He worked overtime, and he was working so hard that he was under severe stress, which
started to affect his personal life.
In the end, he didn’t close the deal—the clients signed with another firm.
Today, I’m going to talk about confidence as a sales tool, and how you can avoid the
traps that this young man fell into.

Let me return to an earlier point briefly.

I’m not in a position to answer that right now, but I’ll get back to you later

I don’t think that’s relevant to today’s discussion.
